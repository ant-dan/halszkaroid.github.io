		<h1 id="#about-me">About me</h1>
		<p>I am a PhD student in Space Traffic Surveillance and Management at Cranfield University. 
		As a graduated space engineer, I've always found a lot of interest in the broad fields of astrodynamics, control theory, and numerical analysis of dynamical systems. 
		I have a ton of other minor interests, including philosophy (especially philosophy of mind and metaphysics), writing, cinema, and gaming. 
		In this website I will describe my professional experience, upload academic notes on miscellaneous topics, and list up some potentially silly stuff that I found amousing and interesting. 
		The objectives of this website are for me to learn front-end web development and to have a reference page that is a reflection of myself. 
		At the moment the website is horrendously plain and difficult to navigate, but it'll become better :P.
